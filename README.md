NOTE
I worked with a team on an application that helps users identify dogsâ€™ breed with the use of image recognition and deep learning.
We designed a local database of images of different dog breeds for image recognition of similar features.
It efficiently identifies dog breeds from the inputted image of a dog, gathering a result of 73% average accuracy and an average scan time of 94.01 milliseconds.
We produced deep learning algorithm Convolutional Neural Network model from OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, Pillow, Mathplotlib, Webbrowser, Tkinter, Scikit-Learn, and NumPy libraries.
